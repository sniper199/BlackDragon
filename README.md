## What Is Black Dragon ?

It's A Tool To Automate The Web Reconnaissance Proccess, Which Make It Easier To Gather Informations About Your Target. This Tool Will Help You In Your Bug Hunting Or Web Penetration Testing Operation Because It Not Only Gather Informations About The Target, But Also It Arranges All These Information In A Structed Way Which Makes You Analyse The Data In A Good Way.

This Tool Works In Linux Systems, Specially In Debian & Debian Based Systems Like:

1. Kali Linux

## What Is The Best Use For This Tool ?

This Is An Automated Tool, So Simply You Give It A Target Then Simply The Tool Took All The Information & And Save The Results In Ordered Directories & Files, But When You Do The Recon You Just Use This Tool, But Also You Should Do Some Manual Activity, This Mindmap Shows The Whole Operation Of BlackDragon Recon Methodology:

- [x] [MMNT.ru](https://www.mmnt.ru/int/)
